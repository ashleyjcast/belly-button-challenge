Module 14 Challenge 

Overview
This project is part of Module 14's challenge, where I built an interactive dashboard using JavaScript to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dashboard displays sample data, allowing users to analyze the microbial species found in different individuals' belly buttons.

Features
Interactive Bar and Bubble Charts: Using the samples.json file, a horizontal bar chart and a bubble chart were created to visualize the top 10 microbial species and their relative abundance per sample.
Demographic Information Panel: A panel displays each individualâ€™s demographic information, sourced from the metadata in samples.json.
Dynamic Updates: The layout updates in real-time, generating new charts and metadata whenever a new individual is selected from the dropdown menu.
